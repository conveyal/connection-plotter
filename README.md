# pulsar: examine pulsing patterns in transit systems

Pulsar is a tool to look at [pulsing](http://www.humantransit.org/2010/12/basics-finding-your-pulse.html) in transit
systems by looking at arrival time distributions. It uses [OpenTripPlanner](http://opentripplanner.org) to perform
the graph theory components, and creates the distributions on the client side.
